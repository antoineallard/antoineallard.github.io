      <h2>About me</h2>

      I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Physics Department at the University of Barcelona, Spain, working in collaboration with <a href="http://morfeo.ffn.ub.es/~mariangeles/ws_en/index.php" target="_blank">M. &Aacute;ngeles Serrano</a> and <a href="http://complex.ffn.ub.es/~mbogunya/" target="_blank">Mari&aacute;n Bogu&ntilde;&aacute;</a> from the <a href="http://complex.ffn.ub.es/~clabb/" target="_blank">Complexity Lab Barcelona</a>. I obtained a PhD in Physics from Universit&eacute; Laval in Qu&eacute;bec City, Canada, in 2014 under the supervision of <a href="http://dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca" target="_blank">Louis J.

      <h2>Research Interests</h2>

      Complex systems are composed of many <i>microscopic</i> elements whose interactions lead to emergent <i>macroscopic</i> behaviours. These systems can be of diverse nature: biological (e.g., food webs of ecosystems), technological (e.g., Internet, power grids), or social (e.g., contact/social networks). Examples of emergent properties are the robustness/stability to perturbations of ecosystems, the navigability of the Internet without an explicit knowledge of its global structure, and the susceptibility of a population in regard to large-scale epidemics of emerging infectious diseases.

      <br>
      <br>

      Understanding the behaviour, or <i>function</i>, of complex systems is achieved through the study of the <i>structure</i> of the interactions between their constituting elements. This in turn is achieved through a network&#8212;or graph&#8212;paradigm in which the elements are represented by nodes linked together if they interact in the original system. Statistical mechanics, graph theory and non-linear dynamics then offer a well developed set of concepts and mathematical tools to study and to model the interplay between the structure and the function of complex systems.

E</b> &#8212; Our latest work titled <a href="publications.html#Allard2015">General and exact approach to percolation on random graphs</a> has appeared in Phys. Rev. E. This paper proposes a comprehensive and versatile theoretical framework to study site and bond percolation on clustered and correlated random graphs. This framework encompasses most of the models published to this day and also makes it possible to model structural properties not yet included in a theoretical model. Our approach can also be adapted to model interdependent graphs in an equally general fashion.

This paper shows that under some quite ubiquitous conditions, many detection algorithms fail to identify overlapping communities across multiple scales, leaving a significant fraction of the network uncharted. A meta-algorithm consisting in successive applications of the original detection algorithm is then shown to circumvent this resolution limit.

      <b>2014.09.11 Mathematical modelling of zombies</b> &#8212; A few years ago, my former colleagues and I contributed a chapter to the book <a href="http://www.press.uottawa.ca/mathematical-modelling-of-zombies" target="_blank">Mathematical Modelling of Zombies</a> edited by <a href="http://mysite.science.uottawa.ca/rsmith43/" target="_blank">Robert Smith?</a> (the question mark is not a typo) from the University of Ottawa, Canada. Using the humorous pretext of an imminent zombies invasion, this books aims to initiate health care researchers to mathematical modelling. Besides introducing the reader to graph theory, numerical simulations and numerical integration, we present in our chapter an enhanced version of a model of <a href="publications.html#Marceau2010">adaptive networks</a> in which we allow susceptible individuals to attack and kill infected individuals (zombies). This chapter has mainly been written during the summer of 2010 and has spent the following years in limbo in the editorial world, but only to come back from the dead in time for Halloween.

      <b>2014.07.15 New paper in Molecular Systems Biology</b> &#8212; <a href="links.html#Collaborators">Aaron Brooks</a> from the <a href="http://isbmolecularme.com/new-open-access-multiscale-model-captures-dynamic-molecular-processes-in-unprecedented-detail/" target="_target">Institute for Systems Biology</a> and his collaborators have just published a paper in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.15252/msb.20145160" target="_target">Molecular Systems Biology</a>. This paper presents the results of a project that was mostly initiated during a conversation between Aaron and I while attending the Sante Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School in 2011. While my contribution to this beautiful work is modest, it is a great example of interdisciplinary collaboration and of how theoretical work in Network Science can find applications in various unexpected scientific disciplines.
      <!--My research is mainly focused on complex network modeling. More specifically, I am interested in developing mathematical models in order to improve our capability to accurately reproduce (and thus hopefully predict) dynamical processes on real complex networks. As a collateral effect, the modeling process by itself is interesting as it highlights fundamental properties of these real systems. Lately, I have been working on extending bond percolation mathematical formalisms to include more realistic complex networks.

      <br>
      <br>

      I am also interested in Information Theory and Bayesian Inference, although I have not done serious research in that direction. Finally, I find interdisciplinary research, in general, very motivating.-->
