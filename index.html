    <span style="font-size:16px">About me:</span><br>
    I am a PhD student in the Physics Department at Universit&eacute; Laval in Qu&eacute;bec City, Canada. I am a member of <a href="http://dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca" target="_blank">Louis J. Dub&eacute;'s research group</a>.

    <span style="font-size:16px">Research Interests:</span><br>
    My research is mainly focused on complex network modeling. More specifically, I am interested in developing mathematical models in order to improve our capability to accurately reproduce (and thus hopefully predict) dynamical processes on real complex networks. As a collateral effect, the modeling process by itself is interesting as it highlights fundamental properties of these real systems. Lately, I have been working on extending bond percolation mathematical formalisms to include more realistic complex networks.<br><br>

    I am also interested in Information Theory and Bayesian Inference, although I have not done serious research in that direction. Finally, I find interdisciplinary research, in general, very motivating.
