The ultimate paper from my time in Qu&eacute;bec City, [Growing networks of overlapping communities with internal structure](/publications/#overlapping), has been published in Phys. Rev. E and the result of my collaboration with [Laurent H&eacute;bert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io) and [Josh Grochow](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~jgrochow) titled <a href="publications.html#OD">Multi-scale structure and topological anomaly detection via a new network statistic: The onion decomposition</a> has been published in Scientific Reports.
