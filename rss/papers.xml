Adv.: Climate change and water management in the biblical city of Dan</title><link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/3/11/e1700954?rss=1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Global climate change has sharpened focus on the social and economic challenges associated with water deficits, particularly in regions where anthropogenic demands exceed supply. This modern condition was also experienced by the people of ancient western Asia, where chronic water shortages were accentuated by recurrent droughts. However, human societies may react to climate change, particularly desiccation, in different ways depending on specific local conditions. Focusing on the biblical site of Tel Dan (present-day Israel), we show the effects of severe precipitation decline in an environment that was well watered and fertile even in times of drought. Such local niches of prosperity became attractive targets for predation when food resources became scarce in surrounding rain-fed areas. We propose that predation forced urban populations to either flee or adopt new subsistence strategies. Predation and abandonment, even if only partial, led to the poor maintenance of water networks in and around the city. Once stagnant water surrounded the area, water-borne disease proliferated. Our study shows how climate changes can disrupt social and political structures, cause water system management to collapse, and facilitate marshland expansion.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">advances;3/11/e1700954</guid></item><item><title>Sci. Adv.: Networks of global bird invasion altered by regional trade ban</title><link>http://advances.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/3/11/e1700783?rss=1</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Wildlife trade is a major pathway for introduction of invasive species worldwide. However, how exactly wildlife trade influences invasion risk, beyond the transportation of individuals to novel areas, remains unknown. We analyze the global trade network of wild-caught birds from 1995 to 2011 as reported by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). We found that before the European Union ban on imports of wild-caught birds, declared in 2005, invasion risk was closely associated with numbers of imported birds, diversity of import sources, and degree of network centrality of importer countries. After the ban, fluxes of global bird trade declined sharply. However, new trade routes emerged, primarily toward the Nearctic, Afrotropical, and Indo-Malay regions. Although regional bans can curtail invasion risk globally, to be fully effective and prevent rerouting of trade flows, bans should be global.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">advances;3/11/e1700783</guid></item><item><title>Nature: Photonic quantum state transfer between a cold atomic gas and a crystal</title><link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nature/rss/current/~3/9Wx3jMYjBZg/nature24468</link><description>Interfacing fundamentally different quantum systems is key to building future hybrid quantum networks. Such heterogeneous networks offer capabilities superior to those of their homogeneous counterparts, as they merge the individual advantages of disparate quantum nodes in a single network architecture. However, few investigations of optical hybrid interconnections have been carried out, owing to fundamental and technological challenges such as wavelength and bandwidth matching of the interfacing photons. Here we report optical quantum interconnection of two disparate matter quantum systems with photon storage capabilities. We show that a quantum state can be transferred faithfully between a cold atomic ensemble and a rare-earth-doped crystal by means of a single photon at 1,552â nanometre telecommunication wavelength, using cascaded quantum frequency conversion. We demonstrate that quantum correlations between a photon and a single collective spin excitation in the cold atomic ensemble can be transferred to the solid-state system. We also show that single-photon time-bin qubits generated in the cold atomic ensemble can be converted, stored and retrieved from the crystal with a conditional qubit fidelity of more than 85 per cent. Our results open up the prospect of optically connecting quantum nodes with different capabilities and represent an important step towards the realization of large-scale hybrid quantum networks.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">10.1038/nature24468</guid></item><item><title>Nature: The internet that wasnât</title><link>http://feeds.nature.com/~r/nature/rss/current/~3/odb6qLN7IyU/d41586-017-07220-w</link><description>Sharon Weinberger weighs up a history of PLATO, a prescient but doomed 1960s USÂ computer network.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">10.1038/d41586-017-07220-w</guid></item></channel></rss>
